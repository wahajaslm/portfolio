# Skills – Wahaj Aslam

## Core Programming & Engineering

- **C (Primary)**  
  - DSP modules, buffer flows, state machines, performance-sensitive logic  
  - Used as main language at Fraunhofer (DSP / codec tooling) and u-blox (NAS state machines)

- **Modern C++ (C++11/14/17)**  
  - Media tools, Windows Media Foundation (MFT) integration, test harnesses  
  - RAII, smart pointers, STL, modular structuring

- **Python**  
  - Evaluation frameworks, batch processing, plotting  
  - Automation of codec tests, trace analysis, small research tools

- **MATLAB**  
  - DSP prototyping, spectral analysis, LPC, envelopes, filter design  
  - Visualization GUIs (WARP multi-hop), thesis experiments

- **Bash + GitLab CI**  
  - Automation scripts, CI jobs, multi-step testing pipelines

---

## DSP & Audio Engineering

- Spectral analysis (STFT, spectrograms)
- LPC analysis, formant / envelope modeling
- Filter design (FIR / IIR) for shaping and smoothing
- Non-linear post-processing / excitation shaping
- Speech bandwidth extension concepts (lowband → wideband cues)
- Experience with codec-oriented DSP workflows

---

## Critical Listening & Perceptual Evaluation

- Hundreds of hours of internal listening tests at Fraunhofer
- Trained to detect:
  - pre-echo, transient smearing
  - metallic ringing, “synthetic” timbre
  - spectral holes, band mismatch
  - stereo image instability
  - roughness, noise, pumping artifacts
- Comfortable correlating what I hear with:
  - spectrograms (Audition, Python/MATLAB)
  - waveform / difference signal analysis

---

## Streaming & Media Ecosystem

- Understanding of:
  - ABR ladders & multiple-bitrate configurations
  - segment-based encoding behavior
  - consistency across renditions / presets
- Practical usage of:
  - **FFmpeg** for pipelines and diagnostics
  - **MediaInfo** for metadata checks
  - MFT-based integration for Windows playback chains

---

## Tools

- **Adobe Audition** – detailed spectral + time-frequency inspection  
- **FFmpeg** – encoding/transcoding, ABR, test pipelines  
- **MediaInfo** – stream and codec metadata inspection  
- Python + MATLAB plotting and analysis  
- Git, GitLab CI, Bash automation

---

## Wireless & Academic Foundations

- WARP SDR experiments (multi-hop, cooperative relays)
- MATLAB visualization tools for wireless experiments
- Academic seminar exposure to Massive MU-MIMO (linear precoding, CSI, beamforming – not a
  professional specialization)

---

## AI & Machine Learning – Strategic Personal Expansion

- Actively expanding into **AI-enhanced media and DSP workflows**:
  - DSP–AI hybrid thinking for audio enhancement and analysis
  - Using small models and RAG concepts to structure engineering knowledge
  - Treating AI as a layer on top of a strong DSP / media foundation
- This is **personal innovation and learning**, not past employer work, and is focused on where  
  media and audio technologies are heading rather than rebranding past roles.
