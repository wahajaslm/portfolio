# Wahaj Aslam — DSP • Audio • Media • AI-Driven Engineering

I design and engineer next‑generation media, audio, and DSP systems with a hybrid scientific + 
industry-focused approach. My foundation comes from C/C++ DSP engineering, critical listening, codec 
evaluation, and streaming‑ecosystem tooling. 

I combine:
- strong DSP & perceptual audio engineering (Fraunhofer IIS),
- embedded & protocol engineering (u‑blox),
- wireless/MATLAB research (TU Darmstadt),
- and a forward trajectory into **AI-enhanced media systems**.

My work blends algorithmic rigor, perceptual intuition, and platform‑aware design across real products.
