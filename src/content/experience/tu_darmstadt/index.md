# TU Darmstadt – Research Assistant (HiWi)

## Role Summary

As a research assistant in wireless communications, I supported experiments using **WARP SDR** and
developed **MATLAB visualization tools** to understand multi-hop and cooperative wireless behavior.
The role sat between research and engineering: turning equations and concepts into real measurements
and plots.

---

## Responsibilities

- Developed MATLAB GUIs to visualize multi-hop paths, relay behavior and packet flows.
- Helped set up and run WARP-based experiments (cooperative forwarding, multi-hop chains).
- Wrote analysis scripts (MATLAB / Python) to interpret logs and timing data.
- Assisted with preparing figures and structured results for academic use.

---

## Achievements

- Delivered visualization tools that other students / researchers could use to understand multi-hop
  experiments more intuitively.
- Helped make experiments more **repeatable**: clearer logging, structured scripts, and consistent setups.

## Narration

This work made wireless systems more “real” for me. Instead of only thinking in terms of channel matrices
and equations, I could see how packets and relays actually behaved in practice. It also taught me that
even research tools benefit from basic engineering discipline—if others are going to use a script or GUI,
it needs to be structured and understandable.
