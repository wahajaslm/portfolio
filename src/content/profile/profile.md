# Professional Profile — Wahaj Aslam
### Audio/DSP Engineer • Embedded Systems • Real-Time Media • Research‑Driven Problem Solver

---

## 1. Who I Am

I am an engineer standing at the intersection of **audio signal processing**, **embedded systems**, and **high-performance software development**. My work is defined by the balance between scientific rigor and the gritty reality of shipping products. I don't just want systems that compute correctly; I want systems that *sound* good and feel responsive.

---

## 2. My Expertise

My core expertise lies in **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** and **Audio Engineering**. I deal with the math of sound—pitch detection, spectral analysis, and speech bandwidth extension—but I also handle the engineering required to make that math run in real-time. Whether it's optimizing FFT pipelines in Core Audio or managing memory constraints in embedded environments, I bridge the gap between theoretical algorithms and working code.

I am fluent in **C and C++** for critical systems work and use **Python** extensively for research and tooling. My experience extends into media streaming and codec internals, where I’ve spent hundreds of hours in critical listening sessions to ensure that what the logs say matches what the ear hears.

## 3. How I Work

My approach is a blend of the scientific and the practical.
*   **Scientifically**, I model signals and evaluate tradeoffs based on theory.
*   **Practically**, I make hard decisions based on latency budgets and CPU constraints.
*   **Empirically**, I validate everything. I prototype in Python or MATLAB, look at waveforms, and trust my ears as much as my metrics.

I thrive in collaborative environments, acting as a translator between researchers who live in the theory and product teams who need shippable features.

## 4. Where I’ve Been

My journey has taken me through world-class institutions. At **Fraunhofer IIS**, known for its contributions to audio standards, I worked on audio codec features and streaming integration, dealing directly with simple C implementations and complex quality analysis. At **u-blox**, I tackled system-level engineering and C++ tooling. Before that, my research at **TU Darmstadt** focused on speech bandwidth extension and wireless modeling.

## 5. What I Bring

I bring end-to-end ownership to every project, moving comfortably from research and prototyping to implementation and evaluation. I offer a strong debugging intuition for timing-sensitive systems and the stability to stay focused when complexity spikes. Ultimately, I am driven by curiosity and the satisfaction of building systems that are clean, predictable, and perceptually meaningful.
