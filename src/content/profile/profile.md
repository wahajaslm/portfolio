# Professional Profile — Wahaj Aslam  
### Audio/DSP Engineer • Embedded Systems • Real-Time Media • Research‑Driven Problem Solver

---

## 1. Who I Am

I am an engineer who works at the intersection of **audio signal processing**, **embedded systems**, and
**high‑performance software development**.  
My background spans **research**, **product engineering**, and **system‑level debugging**, with hands-on 
experience building tools, algorithms, and testing frameworks that must perform reliably under real‑time 
constraints.

I approach problems by balancing:

- scientific rigor,  
- practical engineering constraints, and  
- user‑centered intuition (how the system *should feel*).  

My work ranges from **DSP research** (speech bandwidth extension, pitch systems, wireless modeling) to
**industry-grade product work**, such as audio codec feature development, media streaming, system-level
integration, and critical listening analysis.

## 2. What I’m Good At

### **DSP & Audio Engineering**
- Pitch detection, enhancement, envelopes, filters, formants, spectral analysis  
- Real-time DSP pipelines (Core Audio, vDSP, FFT optimization)  
- Speech bandwidth extension, time‑frequency modeling  
- Algorithm tuning through critical listening and perceptual analysis  

### **Embedded & Systems Engineering**
- C as a primary language (Fraunhofer systems work)  
- Modern C++ for application frameworks, tools, and integration layers  
- Python for research tooling, automation, concurrency, data analysis  
- Real-time debugging, timing constraints, memory-sensitive systems  

### **Media, Streaming & Codec Work**
- Working with internal encoders/decoders  
- Streaming‑relevant features  
- Quality investigations based on artifacts, logs, bitstreams  
- Tools such as FFmpeg, MediaInfo, Adobe Audition, internal QA systems  

### **Signal Testing & Evaluation**
- Critical listening sessions (hundreds of hours)  
- Subjective + objective evaluation of audio quality  
- Artifact identification, regression detection  
- Designing test plans and experiments

## 3. How I Work

### **Scientifically**
I rely on theory where it matters:
- modeling signals,  
- evaluating tradeoffs,  
- tuning algorithms based on measurable behavior.

### **Practically**
I make engineering decisions based on:
- latency budgets,  
- CPU/memory constraints,  
- integration realities,  
not just idealized models.

### **Empirically**
I frequently prototype in Python or MATLAB, validate ideas, compare outputs, and refine them using:
- spectral visualization,  
- waveform inspection,  
- controlled listening tests.

### **Collaboratively**
I work well with:
- researchers,  
- QA teams,  
- firmware engineers,  
- product teams,  
ensuring alignment between DSP theory and product needs.

## 4. Where I’ve Worked

### **Fraunhofer IIS — Audio, Video & Media Systems**
- C as primary development language  
- Audio codec feature development  
- Streaming-related system integration  
- Artifact detection and quality analysis  
- Critical listening evaluations  
- Encoder/decoder feature testing and debugging  
- Worked indirectly with formats and customers such as Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.  

### **u‑blox**
- Systems-level engineering  
- DSP‑adjacent tasks  
- C/C++ tooling development  
- Software testing and integration work  

### **TU Darmstadt (Research)**
- Speech bandwidth extension (master thesis)  
- Wireless modeling and MATLAB tool development  
- Academic research presentations and implementation work

## 5. What I Bring to a Team

- **End‑to‑end ownership**: from research → prototyping → implementation → evaluation.  
- **Strong debugging intuition**, especially in timing-/signal-/quality‑sensitive systems.  
- **Cross‑disciplinary thinking**, blending DSP, embedded design, and software engineering.  
- **Fast context ramp‑up** due to years of switching between research and product environments.  
- **Stability under complexity** — I thrive in problem spaces where correctness, latency, and subjective 
quality all intersect.

## 6. Personal Narrative (Short)

I enjoy building systems that *sound good*, not just ones that *compute correctly*.  
Much of my work centers around bridging the gap between raw algorithms and real‑world perception—whether 
I’m tuning a bandwidth extension model, optimizing a pitch detector, or helping evaluate codec behavior.

I’m driven by curiosity, long-term skill growth, and the satisfaction of making complex systems behave in
clean, predictable, and perceptually meaningful ways.

## 7. Personal Interests

- DSP research & algorithm design  
- Audio enhancement and reconstruction  
- Musical interface design (gestural controllers, pitch tools)  
- Wireless systems  
- System-level tooling, automation, and testing  
- Continuous self‑improvement and learning
