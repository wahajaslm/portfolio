I didn’t create this project because I was looking for another section to add to my website. I created it because I discovered something mildly disturbing after years of working.

**My CV had become a stranger.**

The titles were correct and the job descriptions were technically accurate, but the real substance of my work was completely missing. The problems I solved, the systems I built, and the mistakes I learned from didn't exist on paper. Everything felt flattened and dehydrated. My career looked like an over-compressed audio file that was recognizable but missing all the richness. The strangest part wasn’t that others couldn’t see the real work I had done. The strangest part was that I had started to forget half of it myself.

It hit me when I tried to update my CV properly. Scrolling through old sections, I realized I had to think hard just to remember certain projects I once worked on daily. Technical decisions I made confidently back then were now blurry details buried under years of new responsibilities. That’s when it clicked.

**A CV is not a portrait. It is a passport photo.**

It is flat, tiny, and only vaguely similar to the real person. I decided I didn’t want to be represented by something that forgettable.

Before anything became a project, it became an excavation. I opened old internship reports, thesis documents, job folders, research notes, side projects, and random screenshots. I even found files with suspicious names like `final_v3_realfinal_OK.pdf`. Some of it made me laugh, some of it made me nostalgic. But the more I organized, the more overwhelming it became because a mountain of content is still a mountain. If I tried to dump all of it onto a webpage, I knew no one would read it—not even me. Organization alone wasn’t enough. I needed something that could make sense of it all.

This was the moment the idea sharpened. Instead of juggling fifteen versions of a CV or writing summaries for every purpose, I wondered if my portfolio could adapt. I wanted to know if it could answer different questions or tell different stories based on what someone needs to know.

**What if my career could talk back?**

That is how the idea of a Live Portfolio came to life. It is a system that doesn’t just display my work, but actually understands it. Emotions got me started, but systems thinking finished the idea. I began treating my career like an engineering problem. I took all the raw data of documents and timelines, structured them by skills and responsibilities, and looked for the meaning in what those experiences actually say about me. It became an encoder for my professional identity: taking the messy but meaningful journey as input, and outputting tailored, coherent human explanations.

This felt more like me than any CV I had ever written. Part of this project is absolutely me refusing to let anyone judge my entire engineering life in the eight seconds they spend scanning a CV. But the other part is personal. I realized I needed something alive that grows with me. It is a rebellion against being reduced to two pages, a system that keeps my work alive instead of archived, and a tool that helps me understand myself as much as others understand me. Most of all, it’s an honest attempt to represent myself properly—not as a static document, but as an ongoing story.
