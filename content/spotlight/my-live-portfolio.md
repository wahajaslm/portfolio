# 🎞 My Live Portfolio

VHS Intro — This tape is the “why” behind one of my most personal projects. It’s the story of how a career outgrew a PDF and turned into something alive.

## Why a Live Portfolio

My CV started to feel like a stranger. Titles and descriptions were correct, but the substance was missing. Everything meaningful was compressed until it sounded flat—recognizable, but dehydrated. I wanted the version that still breathes.

## When the PDF Broke

Updating the CV felt like staring at an old passport photo. I had to work to remember projects I once lived daily. A CV isn’t a portrait; it’s a tiny snapshot. I didn’t want to be reduced to that.

I went digging: internship reports, thesis docs, side-project folders, screenshots, even files named “final_v3_realfinal_OK.pdf.” It was funny and nostalgic—and it showed me how much nuance I had lost.

## Letting It Talk Back

The idea sharpened: what if my portfolio could answer different questions and tell different stories based on who was asking? What if it could link past work to future goals without endless rewrites? I wanted a system that understood my work instead of just displaying it.

Part of this is rebellion against being judged in eight seconds. Part of it is memory: skills fade, details blur, and I don’t want to forget who I became along the way.

## Engineering the Idea

- Input: the messy but meaningful journey—documents, roles, timelines.
- Structure: skills, tags, technologies, responsibilities.
- Meaning: what these experiences actually say about me.
- Output: narratives that adapt without losing the human tone.

It’s an encoder for my professional identity: messy journey in; coherent, situational story out.

## What It Really Is

- A way to keep work alive instead of archived.
- A tool that helps others—and me—understand the journey.
- A reminder of everything I’ve built and learned.
- A system that keeps growing as I do.

VHS Outro — Tape ends here. The technical machinery lives on a separate tape. This one is about the person building it.
