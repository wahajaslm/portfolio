🎞 My Live Portfolio

Why I Turned My Career Into a Living System Instead of a PDF

⸻

VHS INTRO

This tape contains the story behind one of my most personal projects: My Live Portfolio.
It’s not a technical breakdown. It’s the “why” — the honest, slightly funny journey that started when I realised my CV no longer matched the person I’ve actually become.

Press play to enter the archives of my own professional confusion and rediscovery.

My Live Portfolio — The Article (Polished Version)

I didn’t create this project because I needed another fancy section on a website.
I created it because, after years of working, I discovered something mildly disturbing:

My CV had become a stranger.

The titles were correct.
The job descriptions were accurate.
The bullet points looked well-behaved.

But the real substance of my work — the problems I solved, the systems I built, the mistakes I learned from, the ideas that actually shaped me — none of that existed on paper. Everything felt flattened and dehydrated. My career looked like an over-compressed audio file: recognisable, but missing all the richness.

The strangest part wasn’t that others couldn’t see it.
The strangest part was that I had forgotten half of it too.

1. When a PDF stops being enough

It hit me when I tried to “properly update” my CV.
Scrolling through old sections, I realised I had to think hard just to remember certain projects I once worked on daily. Technical decisions I made confidently back then were now blurry details buried under years of new responsibilities.

That’s when it clicked:
A CV is not a portrait.
It’s a passport photo — flat, tiny, and only vaguely similar to the real person.

I didn’t want to be represented by something that forgettable.

2. Excavating my own past

Before anything became a project, it became an excavation.

I opened old internship reports, thesis documents, job folders, research notes, side projects, random screenshots, and files with suspicious names like “final_v3_realfinal_OK.pdf”. Some of it made me laugh. Some of it made me nostalgic. Some of it made me wonder how I ever did those things and then just… moved on.

But the more I organised, the more overwhelming it became.
A mountain of content is still a mountain.

If I tried to dump all of it onto a webpage, no one would read it.
Not even me.

Organisation alone wasn’t enough.
I needed something that could make sense of it.

3. What if my career could actually respond?

This was the moment the idea sharpened.

Instead of juggling 15 versions of a CV or writing summaries for every purpose, I wondered:

What if my portfolio could adapt?
What if it could answer different questions?
What if it could tell different stories based on what someone needs to know?

What if it could link past work to future goals, without me manually rewriting everything?

Basically:
What if my career could talk back?

That’s how the idea of a Live Portfolio came to life — a system that doesn’t display my work, but understands it.

⸻

4. The honest human motivation

Let’s be direct.
Part of this project is absolutely me refusing to let anyone judge my entire engineering life in eight seconds of CV scanning.

The other part is personal: I don’t want to forget who I became through all these years. Skills fade when they aren’t revisited. Memories blur. Achievements shrink when squeezed between bullet point formatting.

I realised I needed something alive — something that grows with me, remembers for me, and helps me articulate my own capabilities with clarity, not guesswork.

5. Then the engineer in me took over

Emotions got me started, but systems thinking finished the idea.

I began treating my career like an engineering problem:
	•	Raw data: documents, projects, roles, timelines
	•	Structure: skills, tags, technologies, responsibilities
	•	Meaning: what these experiences actually say about me
	•	Outputs: narratives for specific situations
	•	Interface: simple, natural, adaptable

It’s basically an encoder for my professional identity:

Input → messy but meaningful journey
Output → tailored, coherent, human explanations

This felt more “me” than any CV I had ever written.

⸻

6. What My Live Portfolio really is

It is:
	•	A rebellion against being reduced to two pages
	•	A system that keeps my work alive instead of archived
	•	A tool that helps me understand myself as much as others understand me
	•	A way to tell richer stories without overwhelming people
	•	A personal reminder of everything I’ve built and learned
	•	A project that grows as I continue evolving

But most of all, it’s an honest attempt to represent myself properly — not as a static document, but as an ongoing story.

VHS OUTRO

Tape ends here.
The emotional journey is complete.

If you’re curious about the technical machinery behind My Live Portfolio — the data models, the structure, the AI logic — that’s on a separate tape in the archive.
This one was never about the system. It was about the person building it.

Back-Cover Summary

A reflective and slightly humorous story about why I built My Live Portfolio. After years of work compressed into a lifeless CV, I went back through my past, rediscovered forgotten projects, and realised I needed a living system that understands and expresses my career in a way a PDF never could. This article is the story behind that decision.
