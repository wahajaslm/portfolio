<p>🎞 My Live Portfolio</p>
<p>Why I Turned My Career Into a Living System Instead of a PDF</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>VHS INTRO</p>
<p>This tape contains the story behind one of my most personal projects: My Live Portfolio.
It’s not a technical breakdown. It’s the “why” — the honest, slightly funny journey that started when I realised my CV no longer matched the person I’ve actually become.</p>
<p>Press play to enter the archives of my own professional confusion and rediscovery.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<p>My Live Portfolio — The Article (Polished Version)</p>
<p>I didn’t create this project because I needed another fancy section on a website.
I created it because, after years of working, I discovered something mildly disturbing:</p>
<p>My CV had become a stranger.</p>
<p>The titles were correct.
The job descriptions were accurate.
The bullet points looked well-behaved.</p>
<p>But the real substance of my work — the problems I solved, the systems I built, the mistakes I learned from, the ideas that actually shaped me — none of that existed on paper. Everything felt flattened and dehydrated. My career looked like an over-compressed audio file: recognisable, but missing all the richness.</p>
<p>The strangest part wasn’t that others couldn’t see it.
The strangest part was that I had forgotten half of it too.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="when-a-pdf-stops-being-enough">When a PDF stops being enough</h2>
<p>It hit me when I tried to “properly update” my CV.
Scrolling through old sections, I realised I had to think hard just to remember certain projects I once worked on daily. Technical decisions I made confidently back then were now blurry details buried under years of new responsibilities.</p>
<p>That’s when it clicked:
A CV is not a portrait.
It’s a passport photo — flat, tiny, and only vaguely similar to the real person.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to be represented by something that forgettable.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="excavating-my-own-past">Excavating my own past</h2>
<p>Before anything became a project, it became an excavation.</p>
<p>I opened old internship reports, thesis documents, job folders, research notes, side projects, random screenshots, and files with suspicious names like “final_v3_realfinal_OK.pdf”. Some of it made me laugh. Some of it made me nostalgic. Some of it made me wonder how I ever did those things and then just… moved on.</p>
<p>But the more I organised, the more overwhelming it became.
A mountain of content is still a mountain.</p>
<p>If I tried to dump all of it onto a webpage, no one would read it.
Not even me.</p>
<p>Organisation alone wasn’t enough.
I needed something that could make sense of it.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="what-if-my-career-could-actually-respond">What if my career could actually respond?</h2>
<p>This was the moment the idea sharpened.</p>
<p>Instead of juggling 15 versions of a CV or writing summaries for every purpose, I wondered:</p>
<p>What if my portfolio could adapt?
What if it could answer different questions?
What if it could tell different stories based on what someone needs to know?</p>
<p>What if it could link past work to future goals, without me manually rewriting everything?</p>
<p>Basically:
What if my career could talk back?</p>
<p>That’s how the idea of a Live Portfolio came to life — a system that doesn’t display my work, but understands it.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="the-honest-human-motivation">The honest human motivation</h2>
<p>Let’s be direct.
Part of this project is absolutely me refusing to let anyone judge my entire engineering life in eight seconds of CV scanning.</p>
<p>The other part is personal: I don’t want to forget who I became through all these years. Skills fade when they aren’t revisited. Memories blur. Achievements shrink when squeezed between bullet point formatting.</p>
<p>I realised I needed something alive — something that grows with me, remembers for me, and helps me articulate my own capabilities with clarity, not guesswork.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="then-the-engineer-in-me-took-over">Then the engineer in me took over</h2>
<p>Emotions got me started, but systems thinking finished the idea.</p>
<p>I began treating my career like an engineering problem:
•	Raw data: documents, projects, roles, timelines
•	Structure: skills, tags, technologies, responsibilities
•	Meaning: what these experiences actually say about me
•	Outputs: narratives for specific situations
•	Interface: simple, natural, adaptable</p>
<p>It’s basically an encoder for my professional identity:</p>
<p>Input → messy but meaningful journey
Output → tailored, coherent, human explanations</p>
<p>This felt more “me” than any CV I had ever written.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="what-my-live-portfolio-really-is">What My Live Portfolio really is</h2>
<p>It is:
•	A rebellion against being reduced to two pages
•	A system that keeps my work alive instead of archived
•	A tool that helps me understand myself as much as others understand me
•	A way to tell richer stories without overwhelming people
•	A personal reminder of everything I’ve built and learned
•	A project that grows as I continue evolving</p>
<p>But most of all, it’s an honest attempt to represent myself properly — not as a static document, but as an ongoing story.</p>

<p>VHS OUTRO</p>
<p>Tape ends here.
The emotional journey is complete.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about the technical machinery behind My Live Portfolio — the data models, the structure, the AI logic — that’s on a separate tape in the archive.
This one was never about the system. It was about the person building it.</p>

<p>Back-Cover Summary</p>
<p>A reflective and slightly humorous story about why I built My Live Portfolio. After years of work compressed into a lifeless CV, I went back through my past, rediscovered forgotten projects, and realised I needed a living system that understands and expresses my career in a way a PDF never could. This article is the story behind that decision.</p>
